    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is the best French toast recipe. It's different because it uses flour. I have given it to some friends and they've all liked it better than the French toast they usually make! </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup of milk</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>12 thick slices bread</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Step 1: Measure flour into a large mixing bowl. Slowly whisk in milk. Whisk in eggs, sugar, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and salt until smooth.</li>
